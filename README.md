## Financial News Sentiment Analysis 

Financial News Sentiment Analysis utilizes finBERT model from hugging face library to perform realtime sentiment analysis of news headlines published on FinViz.com.

`get_latest_news()` function in `scraper.py` scrapes news headlines using beautiful soup library. The streamlit web application is programmed in `app.py` and performs sentiment analysis by importing `finBERT` model and tokenizer.

`requirements.txt` has all the libraries and their versions this application depends upon.
